# geo-reactnative

A time-boxed evaluation of React Native, building out an iOS/Android app (primarily for comparison with [geo-flutter](https://github.com/rhydiant/geo-flutter)).

Based on [harmony-ui-kit-sketch-freebie](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/2657-harmony-ui-kit-sketch-freebie-resource.html) as the design spec and a [sandboxed API](https://getsandbox.com/sandboxes/willyweather-stub).

See [Wiki](https://github.com/rhydiant/geo-reactnative/wiki) for more.

## Usage

Follow the [install instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) to setup React Native.

### Running the app

Start a [simulator](https://github.com/rhydiant/geo-reactnative/wiki/Simulators) and do `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.
